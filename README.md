# wavefit
GUI interface for fitting sine waves and extracting phase/harmonics/etc.  Has the ability to aquire signals directly from some ethernet connected oscilloscopes (e.g. Rigol DS1054).

This can be installed either as a global python module, in which case the the `qtwavefit` command will be made available in the command prompt.  Alternatively there is the standalone `qt.py` in the `standalone` directory, which does not require the module to be installed.
